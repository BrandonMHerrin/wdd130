          The Western Whitewater Rafting company was founded in 1999 by a group
          of friends who had a passion for whitewater rafting. They wanted to
          share their love of the river with others and provide a safe and
          enjoyable experience for all who wanted to join them. They started
          with just a few rafts and a small group of guides. They have grown
          over the years and have become one of the premier rafting companies in
          the western United States. They have expanded their operations to
          include trips on some of the most exciting rivers in the country. They
          have also expanded their fleet of rafts and have added more guides to
          their team. They are excited to continue to grow and provide the best
          possible experience for their customers.
