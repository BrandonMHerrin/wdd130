      <p>
        I work full time as an integrations specialist for a local trucking
        company. I work on projects that involve integrating our systems with
        our customers and vendors. I have been working in the IT field for over
        10 years. I have a passion for technology and I am always looking for
        ways to improve my skills. I am currently enrolled in the Web Design and
        Development program at BYU-Idaho. I am excited to learn more about web
        design and development and I am looking forward to the opportunities
        that this program will provide.
